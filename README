This is Tps (Tiny/Transportable PostScript)
by Dennis Heimbigner <dennis.heimbigner@gmail.com>

I had the tarball of tps 2.1c in my archives and it looked like it was
one of the very few extant copies.  I thought it was prudent to
publish it before it's lost in an accident or something.

I have imported tps 2.1c release as-is and polished it up a bit to
compile with modern compilers (mostly adding a lot of const).  The
imake build needs to be replaced and the code still has some
portability provisions that haven't been relevant for the last 20
years, so I plan to do some more work in those areas.
