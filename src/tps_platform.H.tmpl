This file defines various configuration parameters used
in building this version of this system.
It specified the patch level, as well
as the platform info.

The patch level has the form "X.YZ" where X.Y is the base
release, and Z is a letter that is used to sequence
patches for a given release.  Thus 2.1a is the actual first release
of version 2.1 and 2.1b is the first patched to 2.1.
