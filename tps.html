<h3>Description:</h3>
Tps (Tiny/Transportable Postscript)
provides an embedded interpreter for a language that looks
much like a version of Postscript
with all of the graphics operators removed.
The resulting system is roughly the same size and for the same purposes
as Tcl, and the myriad of other embedded language interpreters.
<p>
Obviously the question is: why another embedded language interpreter?
For Tps, the answer is Heterogeneous State Transportability.
This term covers to two abilities.
First, it is possible to interrupt an executing Tps program,
and save the state of the computation in a persistent form.
Later, in some other interpreter, that state can be re-constituted
and the computation can continue.
Second, the state can be restored to a different kind of
machine than the one from which the state was saved,
thus allowing for computation to cross between heterogeneous
platforms.
Note that this differs from the simpler mechanisms of invoking
a program, which cannot accumulate state,
or saving the complete address space
of a Unix process and later restoring it, which is not heterogeneous.
<p>
The key is to be able to package
up the current state of a computation and transport it to some other site
where it can continue execution.
Basically, it is possible to stop the interpreter and save the state,
or start an interpreter and cause it to continue
execution of some previously saved state.
<p>
In addition to state transportability,
there are several other features of Tps that
differentiate it with respect to many
of the other available systems.
<dl>
<dt> Safety.
<dd> The Tps interpreter provides a safe subset
(similar in purpose to Safe-Tcl) with controlled access
to unsafe facilities.

<dt> Documentation.
<dd> Because Tps is so similar to Postscript,
it can build on the many books describing
Postscript and how to program in it.

<dt>State Accessibility.
<dd>The computational state of a Tps program
execution is very visible.  It essentially consists of
the operand stack, the dictionary
stack, and the execution stack.
This is one of the essential supports for state transportability.

<dt>Stepping Behavior.
<dd>Most other embedded languages intertwine their execution
stack with the C process stack.  In particular, when the embedded
language needs to recurse, it does so by recursively calling
its interpreter procedure, which is generally a C procedure.
One of the consequences is that (assuming no threading), it is
difficult to stop a computation and later resume it.
The Tps interpreter does not intertwine stacks, and so can be
stopped and resumed in between any operator invocation.
This provides, among other things, general single step execution
for Tps programs, which is a significant aid to debugging.

<dt>Multiple Interpreters.
<dd>It is possible to create multiple interpreters executing simultaneously.
This capability is actually surprisingly rare.  Tcl, for example,
is one of the few other systems that provides it.
It is rare because many interpreters were written
with the assumption that they were in control
and that only one instance was needed.  Most Scheme interpreters
seem to suffer from this delusion of being in control.

<dt>Extensible types.
<dd>The types provided by Tps are, for the most part, similar to the
non-graphics types of Postscript.  This set currently includes
null, mark, boolean, integer, real, name, string, array, dict, and
stream.  The stream is a generalization of the Postscript file type.
Adding a new type is generally not very difficult.

<dt>Extensible execution stack frames.
<dd>The execution stack consists of a series of frames holding
control information.  Thus, when a stopped operator is executed,
it puts a special frame on the execution stack to implement the stopped
operator semantics.  Similarly, the repeat operator keeps its current count
in a frame on the execution stack.
Adding new kinds of frames is relatively simple, and can even be done
on the fly.
