The documentation for tps
is not automatically constructed
during build since it may not immediately
be needed, and it is often highly
system dependent.

The file doc/Imake.tmpl
contains some site specific information
about tool names:
	LATEX=latex	- a standard latex processor.
	DVIPS=dvips	- this converts .dvi files to .ps (postscript)

To make a postscript file (tps.ps) do the command
	make ps
which will run latex twice (for labels)
and then dvips to get the postscript.
This is obviously irritating, so you may want to edit it.
